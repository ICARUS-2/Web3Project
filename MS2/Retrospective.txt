INDIVIDUAL EVALUATIONS OF SELF AND TEAMMATES (scale on 10):

	-Self: I feel as if I had a good contribution to the sprint efforts. I picked a good balance between both difficult
	and easy tasks to complete, got them done on the first day of receiving the requirements, and communicated them
	effectively. I feel as if I could improve by using branches and maybe reading the documentation for things like
	Bootstrap a little bit better next time. (9/10)
	
	-Tarik: Delivered features in a timely manner and communicated well, but could have selected a few harder 
	ones to complete. (9/10)

	-Phil: Polished his features quite well and fixed some bugs, although could have been a little bit more prepared
	with the lab. (9/10)

	-Aidan: Communication was very solid, and he used branches to keep the Master clean, although could have started
  	on the features a little bit earlier. (9/10)
