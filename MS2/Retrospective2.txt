SPRINT 2 REVIEW

GROUP CONSENSUS: GROUP EFFORT/INDIVIDUAL EFFORT

Good: 
	- Were a lot better with branching
	- Productive use of lab time.
	- Better communication this time around.

Bad: 
	- Sometimes unfinished features pushed to main.
	- Sprint planning could have gone better.
	- Sometimes accidentally implementing other people's features happened.


---
Ethan (SM)
Good:
	- Got everything done right away.
	- Took on a large portion of the work (auth and user subclassing)
Bad:
	- Could have named branches after features.
	- Could have read the auth requirements a little bit clearer.

Phil
Good: 	
	- Was always on top of managing the boards.
	- Communicated very clearly with every group member on a daily basis
Bad: 
	- Didn't finish all stories
	- Poor estimation of task difficulty.

Aidan
Good:
	- Took on a large portion of the work (order/cart system)
	- Named branches appropriately
Bad:
	- Should have documented what he did, as it was somewhat complex.
	- Commit messages could have been slightly clearer at times.

Tarik
Good:
	- Started tasks in a timely manner, well-estimated his workload.
	- Came up with clever solutions involving working with what we had.
Bad:
	- Solutions can be a bit hacky
	- Branch names could have been clearer.


INDIVIDUAL EVALUATIONS OF SELF AND TEAMMATE (scale on 10)

	- Self: I believe I contributed a lot to this sprint, since my feature was probably the
	most difficult one to do this sprint. I also believe that I implemented my features on time
	and rolled out every fix necessary. Although I feel that maybe I could have read the auth
	requirements a little bit more. (9.5/10)

	- Tarik: Always got started on everything the moment he was able to when the auth was finished.
	Features pushed to main were always very polished and bug-free. His solutions could have 
	been a little bit less hacky though. (9.5/10)

	- Phil: The features he was able to implement worked quite well, although I wish he 
	could have started a little bit earlier as he would have been able to get all of his
	stories finished. (8/10)

	Aidan: Contributed a lot of work to the stories, as he took on the massively difficult task
	of handling the order system on his own. His features were very well-polished and worked
	well and bug-free. He also named his branches after his features which made the git
	repo easier to visualize. (10/10)
